##### NOTE: This plugin currently can only run on spigot 1.11 as reflection as not been implimented into the plugin as of yet. If enought support future updates will use reflection for multi version support.

Spigot plugin to make your server more realistic with an HÂ²O bar, temperature and more.

Ever wanted to drink out of water bottles and let them have a use? Or maybe have the lava pits cook you alive? You're in luck! This is a plugin originally started on a private survival server and left sitting for months but has managed to make it way to a public release (somehow).

### What versions does this currently run on?
At the moment it only runs on 1.11 but can be updated to support other versions.

### What does it add?
* Temperature that is relative to the world, what you're holding, what blocks are around you and other environmental factors.
* H2O (water) Bar that slowly depletes and requires you to drink from either a water bottle or bucket (milk, lava or water).
* Some convenient crafting recipes such as the name tag and chainmail to iron.
* Hydration chestplates to let regulate your temperature.

### What's in the planning books?
* This plugin was made for fun but I am open towards support for updates and other developers to change systems and fix bugs found.
* What was in the book:
* Changing from a live per player temprature update to a chunk cache that only updates when a new chunk is loaded in or a block is placed. *This would improve both CPU and RAM usage dramatically.
* More enchantments such as poison.
So will this get updates?
If the plugin gets interest or has other developers interested in working on it yes.

## Events
Current supported events are:
* PlayerDehydrateEvent - Called when a players H2O bar changes.

## Support
Want to helpout on the plugin? Know of a better way to implement soemthing? Start changing the plugin around and I'll do updates as needed!
