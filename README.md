Spigot plugin to make your server more realistic with an HÂ²O bar, temperature and more.

Ever wanted to drink out of water bottles and let them have a use? Or maybe have the lava pits cook you alive? You're in luck! This is a plugin originally started on a private survival server and left sitting for months but has managed to make it way to a public release (somehow).
